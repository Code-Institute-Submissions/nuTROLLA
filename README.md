# Testing

talk about the testing process here, I have put a dropdown menu for this in the readme to hide it as it is a long section of the page

<details><summary>CLICK HERE for testing process'</summary>
<p>

1. The content of the site should resize fluidly to specific breakpoints
    1. Load the website on a large desktop monitor.
    2. Check all pages of the site to check the layout is as expected.
    3. Open developer tools and repeat step 2 at xs, small, medium breakpoints
    4. The layout is as expected and elements will display to fit the device its being displayed on.
    5. This verifies that the site is responsive to different screen size, and aspect ratios.

2. Just keep adding numbered lists for each process taken when testing the site
    1. indent the subitem of the list for each stage of testing
